He helped me out with the pricing too and got me a good deal for R line as it looked better with black alloy wheels and everything.

They asked me when i wanted to book in. I told them my vehicle is there can you please take care of this as i was told all the warranty parts were there prior to the appointment.\n\nI do not think they completed these repairs at all from Wednesday phone call.\n\nI did talk to Phil manager at Chilliwack VW August 6. he told me he was informing Luke to get in contact with me.

I was almost skeptical at how relaxed, professional, and honestly enjoyable the experience was from the moment I first walked in to leaving with my dream car.\n\nMy sales associate Dale actually LISTENED to what I wanted and what was important to me in a vehicle. Kyle and Dane worked hard and fast to get me the car at the price point I wanted even though I was sure it was impossible. Devaughn took the time to walk me through every square inch of the vehicle and answered all my questions. They also gave me a very fair price for my trade in. I could not be happier.\n\nBuying a new vehicle as a young woman who doesn’t know much about cars is a vulnerable and intimidating experience, and many dealerships are happy to take advantage of that. VW Victoria was a breath of fresh air and truly sets the standard for integrity, professionalism, and quality.\n\nThank you all for getting me in my dream car. Keep doing what you’re doing.",

They were super attentive to my messages; whenever I messaged them, they responded very quickly and effectively solved any issues I had. The SUV itself is perfect and meets all my needs.

Jeremy called a few days later, said the tires were in and that he couldn’t stand to see it riding on plain steel wheels so found some beautiful alloys to mount them on at no extra cost to us! Meanwhile a snow storm hit and the roads were terrible so we decided to postpone our appt to have the tires put on in Vernon to the following weekend when the forecast looked better. That would have been fine, but Jeremy drove the winter tires TO US in Kamloops in a SNOWSTORM to ensure our family was riding on safe winter tires. How can you beat that!?",

He was so knowledgeable about many cars, very efficient, friendly and professional and he really listened to me about what I needed out of a vehicle.  Every  person I dealt with there was so kind, friendly and willing to help.  One of the owners introduced himself to me and was genuinely interested in making sure that I was comfortable with my purchase. The whole purchase was so easy and no pressure from purchase to insurance etc.  Buying a car is a big expense for all consumers no matter what their budget is and at times can be a bit daunting especially from a woman’s perspective.  I highly recommend you check out Journey Volkswagen in Port Moody because they are doing business in a very different and professional way than any of the other dealerships I have dealt with in the past year and a half.  Due to my budget, I was growing tired of the whole process because of the demeaning and greedy dealerships approach.  I felt enlightened and relieved that I not only got the car I wanted but I was handled as a customer with honesty, integrity and respectfully.  On top of all that I had a nice surprise from Volkswagen service department that one of the parts they had ordered for my car had come in and that they wanted to schedule a time for me to install it for free. The service department technicians are all red seal mechanics and the inspection report that they did on my car was top notch and once again very professional and handled my vehicle with integrity.  I can’t say enough good things about Volkswagen Port Moody, from the service department to the sales department.  I wish you every success with your purchase should you choose this dealership for your next car purchase.",

I was fed false information until the last minute and put in a situation where I was under pressure to accept a bad deal without having time to digest all the details. After talking to Reggie the sales guy (who promised too much), I had to wait for hours to meet Ashley the finance person who essentially threw everything the sales guy said out of the window and gave me a deal where I had to pay almost double of what I expected. They knew that I was in a tight spot and squeezed me for maximum profit.\n\nOh!

No reimbursement for time out of my days off to come and spend 3 hours in the shop, best they can do is trade my Tiguan for an older one with more KMs. Haven’t even been able to put gas in the car without prying the door open with a key.. still waiting on another service appointment for this issue. There’s been multiple sensor issues, remote start was spotty at best since day 1, cruise control and lane keep being disabled after a software update.. Yes, all covered by warranty, but on my time, feels bad driving this car around not knowing what the next issue will be.",

When I purchased the vehicle there was a “choose your three” or whatever it was called - you could choose three perks - gift cards, accessory gift cards etc. I chose the accessory one right away and said I would let them know for the other two. I have contacted them over a dozen times about this and have not received anything. I emailed head office and eventually they responded with the manager CCd on the email. The manager was great. Initially. However, again, even though I confirmed what I wanted, confirmed my address, he has yet to provide me with the request gift cards. He will no longer respond to emails. Head office has also failed to respond to emails.\n\nCustomer service at the time of purchase is great, but follow up service is terrible. I would never recommend this dealership to anyone.

She went above and beyond to ensure that we were happy with the car. But the best, is that no one there tried to upsell us (something that offended me deeply on VW Abbotsford). They offered and, when we said no, they accepted our refusal and that was it. The warranty was the best that they offered, adjusting for what we found important. The trade-in was with no complications, we were upfront about the issues with the car and they gave us a fair value. Very happy, and will come back for service and for any new VW in my future.",

As i was walking around taking a look at the different cars on the lot James (salesperson) approached and asked if he could help with anything.\n\nAfter a short chat about what i was interested in and a quick walk about he gave me the keys to a Jetta GLI and i drove a little bit to get the feel. I wasn't fully happy with it and still had my eye on the Golf R so he grabbed the keys to a 6 spd manual and away we went.\n\nFrom the time i started the car to when we got back to the dealership James was very informative and helpful with all the features and workings of the Golf R. I had a great time driving it around but wasn't convinced on spending the nearly 60 thousand on a car.\n\nWith my trade in and James help we were able to get the car into a price range i was comfortable with.

Nothing but good and happy thoughts when we think of buying the car.\n\nJason was very accommodating when we had to bring our babies with us to the appointment. He helped entertain the babies while we went over the contract and gave us tips on insurance for the new car.\n\nWhen we signed the contract, we brought my babies and left the baby carrier at the dealership. I reached out to come by and pick up the carrier, but it was always bad timing. 2 weeks went by, and I went to the dealership to pick up the carrier, and it was nowhere to be found. Jason from management called me a few days later and asked me to stop bothering them for the baby carrier and blaming me for leaving the baby carrier behind.\n\nJohn from management offered to replace our baby carrier that we had left behind in Jason's office during the contract meeting. I really appreciate the offer and awesome customer service!\n\nOverall, it was still a good experience. They offered a wonderful shopping and customer service experience despite the unhappy incident! We are very happy with our purchase! I would come buy another car in the future from Gold Key Langley.",

Compared to other dealerships Northland Volkswagen did not pressure the sale of any vehicle. Neil listened to what I was looking for in a vehicle and my price point.\nOn the test drive the Volkswagen Taos was one of beauty with the details in stitching,  the design in the steering wheel along with the quiet drive I knew it was the right SUVW. Each feature of this vehicle is sleek and smooth. Just loving other features of heated steering wheel and moon roof where driving at night has become a new routine.\nWhen it came to receiving the vehicle Volkswagen Northland took care of the transfers and paperwork. The last step was taking the time to show me how all the features worked, then hooking up my phone and app before driving off the lot. They made me feel welcomed anytime if I need anything.\nIf you want the best go to Northland Volkswagen it’s like family.\nI’m a Volkswagen girl now!\nSo on to the next driving adventure in the new Volkswagen Taos.",

Dash was covered in glass shards, and our remote start module and camera wires were left dangling. But hey they took the time to peel off the service reminder and stick it on the new windshield cause that’s what makes them money.  Not to return the car back to me like I dropped it off.

We called on Thursday because we hadn’t heard anything and found out our head gasket needed to be replaced. At not even 30,000 kms!?  After  four days we had to ask them if we were eligible for a loaner. Why wasn’t one offered when they knew they would have it for a major repair? Don’t know. Yes, we could get a rental that had to be VW but we had to drive up to Calgary to get it. (We’re in Claresholm.) Had to wait for approval on the repair as it was under warranty. Got approval and then parts finally arrived but they were working on another head gasket. Two and a half weeks later our car is finally done. Upon arriving I was asked if I had the rental and could I return it to Calgary after we  specifically asked if we could leave the rental at VW Okotoks. I was alone so I told him I had already asked about that and that I wasn’t doing it. Then they try to drop an $380 charge for changing the air and pollen filter they never told us they were changing. I told him that he hadn’t told me about that and I refused to pay for it. They don’t communicate and are dishonest. We spoke to the manager at one point but that made little difference. South Calgary VW is the same manager.\nUpdate: Dec 20 Not even a month after having it back check engine light is back on.",

After paying almost $3300 in repairs my vehicle was given back to me… only to drive 15 minutes away from the dealership and have my vehicle break down AGAIN. When I received my vehicle back the following service it was completely empty of fuel…The following month and a half my vehicle was in and out of their service department and still the issues were not corrected. When I tried to speak with Joshua their manager about it, my calls were ignored. Finally after threatening to take the issue to the media outlets, I  had my calls returned. Upon speaking with Josh I was told the persistent issues were due to the age of my vehicle and not their incompetence. Save yourself the time and money and take your vehicle somewhere else for service. If you are in the market for a new vehicle…purchase it somewhere else. Absolutely deplorable way of doing business.",

He answered all my messages and calls, as needed in a good timely manner.\n\nI am truly disappointed with my purchase of the 2024 VW Taos. There are features that don’t work as they should, including my apple car play which I have included photos. When the vehicle was brought into the service department it was stated that it’s just an update that needs to be made…  it’s a brand new vehicle and it interesting that those updates wouldn’t have been done a couple days prior to me driving off the lot. There is no reason on why my screen should be going completely black or glitching. I was told to just shut the vehicle off and on to reset it. Any vehicle owner of a brand new one should not have to shut it on/off for things to work properly. It’s BRAND new, wasn’t even owned for a couple days before issues happened.\n\nI also am still unable to use my keyless entry for unlocking the doors, and there is a continuous rattling in the front end.\n\nAgain, I am truly disappointed with this vehicle and would never recommend anyone to purchase it.",

I'm a pretty demanding customer when it comes to vehicle purchasing as I don't trust car dealers easily, but they worked with me on everything I asked for from the sales guy, to the finance man straight up to the manager. Trust me, I probably annoyed the crap out of all of them. They all took my calls when I had questions or concerns, ( went out of their way) and got me what I wanted.  And now I'm loving my new SUV.

Had the pleasure of meeting Conner Roe my salesperson. From the moment I sat down at his desk he was attentive, honest, and seemed like he genuinely wanted to earn my business. Part way through our initial conversation Casey Reeder the sales manager came over and introduced himself which was a nice touch, and took the information about my trade.\nWent for a test drive with Conner, and before we got in the car he highlighted every intricate detail of the car in a super simple and professional manner. He truly knows what’s important. That continued when we got in the car.\nAfter the test drive, Casey had a trade number for me which was exactly where I wanted it to be which again highlights their honesty. Conner and I discussed some options, total price and I was sold.\nThen I got to sit with Justin Smith in finance who immediately came across as a genuine human. In the end I settled on some warranty and protection I’d normally get after market outside of a dealer because their prices were fair, competitive, and they just made me feel valued from the second I walked in. Driving for 30 years and having purchased 7 brand new vehicles this was truly the most comfortable buying experience I’ve had, across all levels of the dealership. Forgot, Grant the GM also popped over to say hi at one point, which again super nice touch.\nYou will not go wrong heading into Straightline VW. Ask for Conner, you’ll be happy you did! Exactly what a car buying experience should be!",

I made the trip (1400 km) and the truck was everything they promised.  Louis was out but Claude and Dan made me feel welcome and took good care of me the that day. Details of routine mechanical work that had been done to the truck on intake to Rally were shared in writing, and the vehicle went on to pass BC out of province inspection with flying colors.

Some issues were addressed and covered by sales, while others have not. The rear camera had a crack in protective casing that I have not identified before buying the car and after first car wash fogged up and when I asked the dealership to review this, I was asked to pay $300 for service inspection during which I was told \"your camera is foggy and will require replacement\", for another $2000. While I negotiated the price down to just over $1000, another mechanic used a hair dryer to defog it for me for free. I would have expected the premium VW mechanics to at least try for the $300 I paid.\n\nAdditionally, when I was buying the car, one of the key fobs was missing the physical key, and I was assured by the salesperson that this would be addressed. Nearly one year later, this is still not addressed, and I have been bounced around between sales and service and now lost to the system.\n\nI hope new cars fare better here.",

And after getting your money in a few seconds, getting it back takes several weeks.\n\nThey are never available or responsive on the phone, and even after leaving message, for several times, there is no reply to your message, or even being responsive when you go there in person.\n\nOn top of all, the finance manager, does not ask you the necessary information to apply for an approval to lease or finance car. For me, she put my address incorrectly, and the response to me was disapproval for lease, and financing with a co-signer, and 8% interest rate instead of 5%. While I was approved for financing without cosigner, and interest rate of 5.29%, through another company.\n\nThey advertised on their website that they have an option to sell  their car with 0% interest, but when I asked about it, they ignored that offer.\n\nOverall, I would like to give 0 star out of 5 to this dealership.\n\nIf you are concerned about your convenience, and like to sleep well and without headache, NEVER go to this center.",

From the sales rep to the manager, it was a complete disaster. They messed up every step of the process.\n\nFirst, they got the color of the car wrong—how does a dealership make such a basic mistake? Then came issues with the interiors, and their solution was just to ask us to compromise repeatedly. It felt like they didn’t care about their customers at all or about fixing their mistakes.\n\nThis holiday season, we thought we’d have a new car, but thanks to them, it never happened!\n\nAfter all the goof-ups and back-and-forth, we ended up not getting the car at all because we refused to settle for something we didn’t want, especially when it was their fault.\n\nThis dealership clearly lacks professionalism, attention to detail, and basic customer service. If you’re considering buying a car here, don’t. Save yourself the frustration and go somewhere else.\n\nTo VW reply : No , you got it wrong again , your sales rep said that he was able to get White color with beige interior , and we accepted that . When we were sent papers to sign , I saw it was white exterior and black interior . I called your sales rep right away , even he was shocked that the interior was black .

From the beginning and first time buying a vehicle I will take my maintenance for it elsewhere. I did not feel appreciated, looked after  and did not feel like I had their full attention when I was buying the vehicle. I get it they sell sell sell. But we are people. I was not taken seriously. There was no honesty, respect and customer appreciation. I used my status card to buy the vehicle and I was to follow the sales guy to the location to take a picture on the reserve. He took off before I can even set up my mirrors, lights and adjust my seat so I can safely drive to where he was going. We took the picture on the side of a highway in front of a native sign which there were several along the way. It was not safe at all.",

I originally brought the car in to have the water pump and thermostat replaced under warranty, but they decided not to do the work, claiming “nothing was wrong.” While the tire alignment I requested was completed without issue, I was shocked to find that 20 kilometers had been added to my car’s odometer between drop-off and pick-up. I can’t imagine why a tire alignment would require this kind of distance, making it seem like someone took my car out for a joyride. And when I go to check my dash cam footage, the whole SD card got completely wiped so I no longer have an important video that needed to be reported since the technician wiped the SD card and now all of the footage is gone, so it makes you think who was in my car and what were they doing with my car.\n\nTo make matters worse, the “complimentary car wash” was poorly done. My car was still dirty in the front and back, and to top it off, their supposed “touchless” wash left a noticeable scratch on the roof of my car. Overall, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and questioning the professionalism and care at Owasco Volkswagen.",

When the appt was made it was expressed then that we would drop and wait, We didn't have a have a full day to wait. Car was dropped off Sunday night for a 9am Monday appt. We called st 9 to remind them that we had a 12:30 deadline…. The wheels fell off right then. She advised she “would do her best”\n\nArrived at the dealer shop at 1045 and car was sitting in the parking lot. We were happy that the job was completed!\nWent into see a service adviser and they let us know that the car hadn’t been in yet….!?\nThe adviser was then very dismissive when we shared our time concern and said “ what would You like me to do?” I said then would You have a loaner car? “His response “well no”\n\nService manager comes out and states “Your 9am is for the service adviser not for the shop and You need to communicate better with Us your time constraints”\n\n…Umm Sir, we were very specific of our “time constraints” when We booked and were told it was “just a two hour job and would be done in plenty of time”. Service Manager was “shocked” by this statement! There was a 3.5 hrs allotted for a 2 hr job. But of course they over book.\n\nThen to make matters worse when the car did finally go in after 11am the service technician had Our car door open and was smoking at the car. Service Manager was a little surprised when I took issue with this!\nThen a woman pulled up to the  with a Jetta (no appt) and our technician began to help Her…?!! And brought out a computer to clear codes etc…\nSeems like we will be making a drive elsewhere for future service and maintenance needs.\n\n**update. The service manager did come back out to Us at 1215 and offer a loaner car as we needed to get my F.I.L. To an important medical appt at a Toronto hospital. (Thus our time constraint). That was very appreciated!  He did also give Us two coupons for a detailing. Thank You for hearing Our concerns, and speaking with Your team about importance of communicating customers needs within the team.",

Belleville VW is by far the best dealer we've dealt with over the years. They are always so friendly. Recently, back in December, my daughter had a coolant issue with her Taos. Parts were back ordered, but they were willing to give her a loaner until her car could be fixed. The issue wasn't that bad, so she kept driving it and kept an eye on it. Fast forward to February, service called her and made an appointment to get her car fixed. The job was gonna take quite a few hours, so they gave her a loaner and got to work. A day and a half later, her car was ready. They also changed her rear brakes, which were all under warranty.  The staff are always friendly and know their VWs.

                "text": "Took our 2021 Tiguan that we bought there in a year ago for a check engine light. Took them about 3 visits to figure out what was wrong, an emissions sensor. Light was off for about 8 months then turned on again so we took it back in to see what was wrong. Kept the car for 6 days. Ended up not figuring what was wrong, charged $500 for what amounted to an oil change and didn’t even do any of the work we asked them to do. We asked them to change the breaks while the car was apart for 6 days, nope must’ve been too much to ask for… Customer service is atrocious. Fully admit to getting angry with them but this was after we were told that “the car has 90k km you should expect this” and also told “because the car has less than 100k km, we can’t give you the loaner that your extended warranty covers because your still in the original power train warranty”. For the record the engine light issue has been going on since the car had 50 or 60k km. Car costed about 56k after taxes so I suppose when you shop here you pay about $1000 per km without repair, which they obviously think is fair because we should’ve “expected this”",

The car had more damages than was shared before I had a look at it (and they had me sign). I was fine with the damage that was communicated upfront. However, once inspected, there were more issues than what was previously shared. They promised to repair at least some of the more minor damages since none of it was shared with me.  However, every attempt to contact them to book an appointment has failed. They will not accept your calls, neither respond to your emails, which is a complete turnaround from the constant (almost instantaneous) communication that occurred before the purchase. I received a quote of $4500 at a repair shop to fix at least part of the damages out of pocket. The true cost would be closer to $7000-$8000 to fix everything. Ironically, I paid this amount extra at this dealership to purchase the vehicle because it looked in almost perfect condition compared to other ones I saw elsewhere. This turned out to not be the case but I'm still out the extra amount I paid, I'm still stuck with the damages and still zero communication. If you expect honesty and kept promises, I suggest you go somewhere else.",

They apologized for the condition of the vehicle on delivery and placed a credit on our account for a replacement air filter and installation which was appreciated. Furthermore—the dealership agreed to cover the full replacement cost of the damaged tire and got the replacement done quickly. I am appreciative and will definitely be keeping my business with them.\n\n—\n\nAwful experience with both sales and service at this dealership — with no effort to resolve their issues. If you value your time and quality customer service do not do business with this dealership.\n\nRegarding the vehicle sale: the salesperson disclosed that the vehicle had been smoked in but promised it would be cleaned up and deodorized. Received vehicle on delivery day to discover that none of the air filters had been replaced and the upholstery had visible markings (it had not been detailed). Promise broken. Again, no remedy.\n\nRegarding service: beware that their vehicles are sold with a tire insurance package that limits your services to their dealership only. The service shop won’t take appointments and forced me (and two kids under two years old) to arrive and then drive away with a slow flat tire because they were too busy. My wife went back with the vehicle again on a slower day and they left her waiting two hours. It’s brazen disrespect for people’s time and zero care or consideration for families.",

We were assured that it would be professionally repaired by a local body shop when we made the purchase agreement.  The repair took a longer than anticipated but we were kept informed of the reasons and when we took possession, we were pleasantly surprised that there was no sign of the original damage.  Not being from Sarnia they made the extra effort to work with us to coordinate pick up.  There was a bit of a disconnect in communication between the info from the sales person and sales manager but not significant.  The purchase and pick up went smoothly and the car is as expected.

It is little details like this that make truly exceptional service. Mr. Levine made it right as the car would not start. I appreciate it very much. The reason I did not address it when it happened was I was extremely tired, and did not wish to become angry over a battery.

She was super nice and professional, managing to give me a quote that beat every other offer I had from over 15 dealerships, all without any haggling. Amanda was very patient and didn't push for a sale; in fact, she gave me ample time to reflect and make a decision based on rationality, not emotions. The test drive experience was also amazing. Later, completing all the paperwork with Adrien, the finance manager, was smooth and pleasant. He didn't push anything on me and was very understanding and respectful of my preferences, never challenging or pressuring me about any items I declined.

This time, as soon as we walked into VW we felt impressed by their beautifully bright and spacious showroom. Everyone at the dealership was so friendly and kind (from our sales agent Rosa to the financing agent David), and it was noticeable how there was little to no sales pressure - they just provided us with the information we needed, answered all our questions, and gave us different options until we settled on our purchase. From the first day we set foot in the dealership until the day we drove away with our new Tiguan, it was less than 3 days - which was an important part of our decision, given we are a 1 car family and our existing car was in need of repairs.\nBravo VW, and thank you for making our experience so smooth and stress-free!",

Walter was my sales person who helped me throughout the whole process. From trading in my current vehicle to picking up the new one Walter made the overall experience one of the best interactions I have encountered at any dealership and there have been many. From finding out my needs to catering to them from start to finish he was extremely professional, understanding and was able to deliver without being pushy like a typical sales rep. In addtion Deep, who is part of the service side ensured that I was taken care of while waiting for paperwork to be taken care of as well as making sure that my vehicle had that showroom finish when leaving the dealership. Upon picking up the vehicle Kyle, who takes care of the vehicle pickup made sure that I knew how to use all the features of the car and set up all the features according to the way I wanted. To top it all off before leaving the dealership all three of them made sure to make it a point to make sure everything was setup and explained to me and if I had any questions to not to hesitate and come back in. The overall experience was amazing as well as the after sales follow up to make sure everything was good. Would Definitely recommend seeing the guys over at St. Catharines Volkswagen for all your vehicle needs.",

The car is awesome and the whole experience should be used as an example of how all dealerships should conduct business. Thanks again Peter for everything.",

Then they asked me to remove my review while they look into what they can do to make the wrongs right. Out of good faith I did. This was Oct 2nd, since then I have been trying to get an update from them and nada. Its Dec Now!!!!\nFirst time around the sales guy ghosts me and now the manager. I have been having to deal with this since purchasing it in August. At this point I'm taking this very personal, it's no longer just a business transaction that can be resolved with a goodwill gesture from them. I will be moving my complaint and all the correspondence I had with these people to OMVIC and VW Canada.\n\nOriginal Review:\nThis is not a VW dealer, this is more of a small no name dealer who your parents always tell you to stay away from. Get everything in writing, they verbally promise the world.\nOnce you pay they will never address any of your issues or call you back or even reply to your email to say hey sorry but we can't do anything.\nBought a used vw from them, I'm pretty sure not much was done to check this car. Even the items they told me they did I don't believe anymore. Had to take it to the mechanic after only 500km of driving it. The mechanic confirmed the chips on the glass should have not passed safely. The one in front of the driver that was fixed has a thin crack line all the way to the top, the haldex fluid they said they did was not done. The dsg fluid they said they did can't be checked unless I pay for a change, but doesn't look like it was done either.\nCar was misaligned and one of the tires is fully warm out on the inside. But the dealer apparently aligned the car with the bad tire so now the wheel is always slightly to the left. To top it all off the battery has already failed. The Blower motor had issues, one of the cylinders is giving oil around the spark plug. Who knows how many more things will go wrong.\nPlus they didn't even do simple basic stuff like cabin filter and engine filter.\nBought brand new rims from them for the winter tires. Found out one rim is damaged.\nI try to reach out to them multiple times, but I can't even talk to the person to tell me if this is something they can address or not.\nIf they are to sell a used car like this, at least sell it as-is so people can price thousands on top for fixing it, or they can just get a better car for the money that they needed to put into this one.",

                "text": "BUYER BEWARE. I had came into Volkswagen Dixie after checking out many used cars within the Scarborough and surrounding areas. I found this \"Certified Pre-owned\" VW Jetta 2019 to be very promising, it drove well, it had the specs I was looking for, however, the front bumper was badly beaten up by stone chips. I looked past that and went ahead with the sale on the condition that they repaint the entire bumper for me, the sales man agreed and I went home happy.\n\nSo here's the first red flag: I called back to get a status update on the painting of my bumper and asked to speak to the first sales agent who attended me, he had quit. So, I was assigned another sales agent, ok, no problem.\n\nSecond red flag: I get the call that the car is ready to be picked up, so I pay for an uber to take me to the dealership just to find that only the lip of the bumper was repainted and that there was a rust spot developing under a section of the quarter panel (refer to pictures). As I mentioned it to the sales agent he seemed apprehensive and just kept repeating that his manager wouldnt do anything about it and that they cant do anything about it. On top of it all, the front lip they did end up repainting was a colour mismatch!\n\nThird red flag: my newly assigned sales agent offered me a loaner but to take my car home anyways and he would let me know when the loaner was available. The offer was that I can leave my car at the dealership and have the bumper finished, and have the loaner in the meantime, but I agreed to no avail because I never got the loaner ever.\n\nFourth red flag: on my way home from Mississauga to Scarborough, the rearview mirror falls right off the windshield, just my luck as I had waited a long time for the car to have the bumper repainted. Now, I call the sales agent to tell him about the issue and \"they couldnt do anything about it, as it was not under warranty.\" At this point I'm dealing with all of these issues and I haven't even made my first payment on the car. So, I go to another mechanic to fork up another $700 to get the housing and brackets of the rearview mirror and all its parts reinstalled as the windshield it was on when I bought the VW had been replaced.\n\nI would have thought as one of the safety protocols this dealership adheres by they would have fixed my rearview mirror as it is one of the most integral parts of commuting. But it never happened.\n\nAs anyone would be, I was frustrated with their lack of transparency and customer service, had I have known that I was going to run into all this trouble, I would have definitely never bought this car and looked elsewhere. The reason why I chose a VE dealership is because I imagined since its coming off a VW lot it would have been taken care of with quality service, but that wasnt the case.\n\nGoing back and fourth in ubers (3 trips), and the cost of my now new windshield with the installation of the rearview mirror had cost me alot more than I bargained for, for a car coming out of a dealership, great job guys!\n\nI did end up getting my car back after I left it to get the painting job finished to which they actually did a good job, but overall, this second experience of buying a VW from this dealership has been one of the most excruciatingly stressful and horrible experiences I ever had.\n\nMy advice, check everysingle detail of the car you wish to buy from this dealership and do not put a deposit on it unless you have it writing that you get what you will get the work that needs to be done on it fully done, not partially done. I made that mistake and it has cost me alot more than what I was expecting to pay on the car. Shame that I had to deal with all these issues within the first few weeks of buying this car not having made a single payment yet.\n\nHopefully they can improve their customer service.",

My fiancé and I originally went to Kia to see their cars but got rejected because we didn’t have a trade in. Thankfully at Volkswagen, they were selling without trade ins. My sales representative was Jean-Francois Racine and he is fabulous! He explained what vehicles they had available and what our options were. He was not pushy in anyway and the transaction was smooth. I had to wait 2 months for my car but that’s just the world we are currently living in. Jean-Francois followed up with me the day before and after I picked up my car, even though he was on holiday. He even answered my frantic text on the weekend when I thought I found scratches on my new car (it was just dried soap woops). He was quick to answer my text and book me a service appointment the next day when I got a nail in the tire. Thank you Jean-Francois!",

The second you buy the car, you are rest assured to be kicked to the curve. The first week from buying my 2024 Volkswagen Atlas Execline, it has had multiple problems, from window regulators not working properly, to a whole radio system that was glitching in the screen and had to be replaced (making me wait for 2 months), a wiggly and lose driver seat, a GPS that doesn't work, and the emergency phone call did not work.\n\nI understand car problems happen, but its their lack of care when servicing the car and poor customer service that its my issue. I had to bring the car back 4 times during 2 weeks because they couldn't take the proper time to check the entire car (as I requested) before giving it back (something that should have been done before selling me the new car). Additionally, they couldn't get me the license plate, and gave up after noticing that the SAAQ sent it to the old address of my business. They never called or told me anything for the 2 months. I called 5 times asking for an update, and they would say they'd call back, but nothing. Not a single call. Today I get a call from Danielle, from the service department, requesting I return the loaner today because the radio is fixed. I told him I'm out of town, and he kept arguing back he needs the car today for another client, to the point that it got disrespectful when i told him I needed my license plate for my car. His answer? \"It's not my problem, that's from the sales department, I want my car back today\". It goes to show the lack of care for customers, since he wouldn't even transfer me to the sales department. 5 times I called them, and never got a call back, to now be given back my car after 2 months and multiple problems later, and now without a license plate.\n\nOnce you pay, you're not their problem anymore. I should've read the reviews sooner, as there has been many similar problems regarding their service quality and poor customer service.\n\nNEXT TIME, BUY FROM BYTEK VW OTTAWA. They have a proper trackrecord with quality service, and they always take care of their customers without making them feel like they've been stranded.",

A classier business would have offered some kind of compensation/peace offer.\n\nBuying customers from Ontario shouldn't have to have 3 sets of purchase contracts and letters from a Quebec dealer to the Ontario licensing office over 16 days to register a vehicle. A simple thing of spelling my name wrong on 3 different contracts, spelling it wrong 3 different ways was unbeatable! All the mistakes were spelling my name wrong on the purchase agreement, multiple times- I can't figure out how that was possible!\n\nAt least my daughter loves her new car, it just wasn't the experience that it should have been buying her first car. That is what saddens me most, that you took the fun and excitement out of her experience and we can never get that part back.\n\nSincerely, Steve.",

Initially, my experience was positive with the previous after-sales manager, who handled the repair of my roof and quarter panels efficiently. However, the remaining repairs to my two doors were delayed as the parts had not yet arrived. When the parts did come in, I spent an additional 4-5 months following up with the new after-sales manager before finally getting an appointment. Unfortunately, the quality of the work I received was nothing short of unacceptable.\n\nThe doors were painted in a completely different color from the rest of my vehicle and were installed unevenly. After consulting with multiple other mechanics and dealerships, it was unanimously agreed that this was a substandard job. When I approached Spinelli to correct their work, they refused, stating that they were not responsible for paint blending and advised me to contact Volkswagen Canada. This, however, was not an issue of blending—the doors were clearly painted the wrong color.\n\nI then escalated the issue to Volkswagen Canada, only to be met with further frustration. After a month of back-and-forth, they simply referred the case back to the dealership, offering no resolution. This circular process between the dealership and Volkswagen Canada has been an utter waste of time and demonstrates a complete lack of accountability.\n\nGiven the poor service, lack of responsibility, and inadequate communication from both Volkswagen Spinelli and Volkswagen Canada, I will not be purchasing another Volkswagen vehicle in the future. I expect far better from a brand of this stature, and this experience has been deeply disappointing.",

They changed my radio two days later I was still having the same issues reached out to the dealership multiple times over a course of weeks never received a call back until I finally filed a complaint in which they ended up contacting me telling me they didn’t see anything on file took in everything that needed to be done on the vehicle provided me an appointment for December 4 told me that it would be four hours.\nMy appointment was for 8 AM. My husband had an appointment for 3:30 PM when I contacted the dealership to see where they were in servicing my vehicle they advised me that it was still being worked on however, I received notifications via my app that they only access to my vehicle at 2 PM. I had to leave work an hour and a half early to assist my husband to his appointment since he had no way there. Upon receiving my vehicle i was not able to connect to apple car play finally was able to connect via bluetooth. Today dec 6th i get in my vehicle and my screen is completely BLACK. Wont turn on , mind you the acreen controls everything so now i cant turn off / lower my heat, i cant turn my heated seat on , i cant access my back up camera. I am so fed up with this vehicle IF YOUR LOOKING TO LEASE / PURCHASE THE ATLAS CROSS SPORT I WOULD INVESTIGATE BEFORE HAND!!!!!\n\nOn top of all of this i forgot to mention that we had a huge scrape / missing paint on the roof of our vehicle that we realized a few days after delivery and the dealership tried blaming us for this issue.\n\nCountless phone calls / appointments, constant disappointment, nothing to make up for these errors / inconveniences.\nI will from now on have my vehicle serviced at another VW location as i can no longer trust in their service.",

I had to go see someone siting at his desk, looking at his phone. He then said someone else would take care of me.\n\nLou, came to see me and he was alright. I have nothing bad to say about him. Very helpful, and came with me on a ride in the car ad my vehicle was being evaluated as an exchange\n\nWhen we came back to the dealership, I met with the director that evaluated my car. He first asked me if I had ever had a certain maintenance done to my car, head gasket if I recall correctly, and continued saying that this was a usual problem on that particular model and that was why he was giving a lower price on my car. I then said that I could also ask a reduction on the car I was there for as I also could speculate problems on that particular model. I get it, it’s the business. But the way he was belittling me when he was explaining he had no margin was unfortunate.\n\nWhen we looked at the numbers, he then said there was an additional 500$ fee he needed to add, as this was added to all the cars in all dealers to guarantee the rate.  That 500$ fee was never mentioned on the brochure (website) nor did I see little writing mentioning that fee. When I mentioned that this practice was illegal, he then said he would not charge that fee just to show me his good intentions.  At that point I knew I would never buy a car from that dealership and left a few minutes later.\n\nI went to 4 other dealership St Bruno, Drummondville, Granby and Brossard and none of then where asking for a 500$ fee to guarantee the rate. They never even heard of that kind of fee and confirmed that it was illegal to do so.\n\nHopefully they understand that a client that comes in and leave with a bad experience is more likely to talk about it to friends, family and others. We all need cars, but dealerships need customers.",

I was told over the phone that’s the best they can do. Mind you, they told me the inspection takes only 30 minutes. My car has an urgent issue that must be resolved immediately. I cannot wait three months. I am disgusted by this lack of service and apathy. Once they sell you a car they don’t care what happens after. Also, I had filled out the service request on their website and was told someone would call me to schedule the appointment. One month later, nobody called me despite being promised that, so I had to call the dealership myself. No explanation or apology was provided, as you can imagine. Do yourself a favour and avoid this place if you can.",

His lack of professionalism was evident through dismissive behavior and a clear focus on sales rather than addressing my concerns. Communication was extremely poor, with promises conveniently forgotten. The car they presented had a defect not disclosed in their advertisement, and they insisted I pay an additional $4,000 to fix it beyond the advertised price. This experience with Volkswagen, a reputed brand, was shockingly poor in terms of customer service. I strongly advise others to reconsider visiting this dealership and would actually recommend avoiding it altogether to prevent potential scams. A formal complaint has also been launched with Volkswagen.",

I replaced the fuse and took it in for service. They charged me a diagnostic fee to tell me they don't know what the problem is and to bring it in with a blown fuse. So I did that, and they charged me another diagnostic fee and then  hundreds to replace some part. I still have the same problem. It seems like a basic issue but dangerous, I only know it's out when cars flash and drivers honk and wave me. And I have no trust to take it back there.\n\nNext, I described a ventilation issue I had, they charged me a diagnostic fee, then told me I'm imagining. So I sat them in the car and showed how the driver side does not blow air. They charged me another diagnostic fee and gave me an estimate of $1700. Spoiler alert: the friggin' vent had the plastic lever snapped in two, so I don't know what qualifications you need that you can't diagnose such a \"subtle issue\", but hey it's hard work apparently. The reason I didn't have it fixed there was their unprofessionalism and attitude. And I am glad they behaved like that because surprise and shock was when I had that resolved at another service for $450 total, OEM parts and everything. VW sells the part for 200 lol and to replace it was a half an hour work. I understand difference in prices because one place is more fancy. But a quote 4 times the cost? How can anyone justify that??? Cost me more to pay for pseudodiagnostic than to have it fixed somewhere else. Btw, I asked if I can have a second diagnostic waived since the first time they were incapable of diagnosing anything: of course NO.\nAlso btw, the guy with the ponytail: bad attitude and incompetent.\nSo yeah, I am done. Never again doing business here.",

She travels on the road a lot and requires a reliable and economic car. Her car of choice was a used Tesla and she found one at this dealership. The salesperson Sebastien was very courteous and made it a point to interact with her. She took it out for a test drive, liked it very much and decided to purchase it. We were told that the price included a set of winter tires that were in the car. We also negotiated some minor repairs.  This part of the experience was very good. However, the actual transaction was quite difficult at times with unreturned calls, no answer and no voice mail. We did however persevere and eventually made arrangements for vehicle pick. We drove two hours for the pick up. Once there, we were greeted by another (courteous salesperson) but were surprised to find that the tires we negotiated were no longer in the car. We were told that they were in storage and that the manager would email us with details for pick. That email never came. When we followed up with the salesperson, we were told that they threw out the tires and no longer had them (too used). My issue with all of this lies in the negotiated price (which included the tires), the fact that we did not receive what was agreed upon and that the dealership never communicated the change with us. We have since followed up to express our disappointment. There has not been a response. Very unfortunate and unpleasant experience.",

The whole dealership had no idea where my car was (they did, they just didn’t want to tell me what happened) the sales person, Mohammed was also lying to me just to get me off his case about where my car was, eventually after going in multiple times last weekend they finally told me my car was at a body shop. Which it had no reason to be and no one told me why it was there. I went to see my car for myself, they damaged my side skirt and weren’t planning on painting it at first, they were just planning on reattaching it and acting like nothing happened even though it was pretty scratched up as well as the clear coat was chipping off… I’ve had my whole car ceramic coated which they did not know about and I would have eventually noticed as I am a detailer and I take very good care of my golf r. I was very disappointed that the service advisor Melanie did not tell me what was going on. Instead she told me the wheel bearing was defective and they had to order another one which is why my car was taking so long when really one of the mechanics just damaged my car. The service manager Christian was great. He got my car repaired and everything was fixed. I don’t recommend coming here and if you do, do not trust the service advisor Melanie unless you’re okay with dishonesty. I have gotten services done at many Volkswagens and I have never come across a service advisor lying to the clients. This was not ok.",

                "text": "Avoid Grenier Volkswagen in Mascouche at All Costs!\n\nI had the absolute worst experience with the sales team, particularly Mathieu, the Sales Director, and Xavier, the Sales Associate. They engaged in dishonest sales tactics from the start. We negotiated a rental contract with a monthly payment that fit my budget, and I left a deposit on the car. However, despite repeatedly asking for a copy of the detailed rental contract, I only received it 24 hours later after persistent follow-ups.\n\nTo my shock, the contract omitted a crucial detail — the winter tires, which they later quoted me at $2300! This raised my monthly payment by $125 more than what we had initially agreed upon. After discussing their lack of transparency and how they were essentially trying to corner me into a deal we hadn’t fully discussed, I asked to back out of the contract and requested my $500 deposit back.\n\nIt’s now been 3 days, and I’ve yet to receive any communication regarding my refund. The Director of Grenier Volkswagen was supposed to call me today (September 25th) but never did. I am now left having to harass them for my own money, which I suspect they plan on keeping.\n\nIf you’re in the market for a Volkswagen, save yourself the headache and **go to another dealer**. My husband and I have had 3 Volkswagens – great cars, but this dealership is a nightmare. I highly recommend Volkswagen Griffintown or Laval. We’ve had positive experiences there. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of going to Grenier Volkswagen in Mascouche, and it’s been a disaster. My husband is due to renew his lease and has now decided to go elsewhere or with a competitor — even if it means driving 25km for better service.\n\nSave yourself the trouble and avoid this dealership!",

Jade asked if I had received the previous 2 e-mails and I responded, what e-mails?  I explained a month or 4 weeks prior I called Grenier VW regarding the vehicle and was told it was sold. I was never given the salesman name and mine was never asked for either, so how do they have a record of my call? Jade responded that they did not receive the first communique from me till Sept 5th, I take it they have no clue 4 weeks earlier I called on the phone and was told it was sold. That was never considered. I was told I was confused and was thinking of another dealership. Jade knows better! I explained to Jade that, I know I am not confused here. This 2019 Carbon white R has a massive paint spill in the trunk floor and also the parcel shelf is missing. This makes it unique to all other “R”s offered in Canada. I was told a month ago that the vehicle was sold hence my frustration and confusion.\n\nJade’s same day response was, I don't think I deserve your frustration, especially since I'm simply trying to help you on this Saturday when no one is working since the dealership is closed. No-one asked that I be contacted on their day off. If you need a break from work then take one and if work sucks that much quit and find something else. To say Jade is fragile is an understatement!\n\nI send my last e-mail with, There is no frustration on my end. I know what I am talking about and you are just making assumptions. If you are going to make judgements and jump to conclusions then forget about it. I will post appropriate feedback for you and let’s end it here.\n\nI walked about from Genier VW and Jade for this car, because I hated the way I was treated. Jade is not an employee or a representative that any comany would wish to have them represent them, yet Grenier VW seems to accept this decission!!",

I paid for the extended guarantee to be covered until 100,000km. I came to see them right before my guarantee ended because I had been feeling a problem with my suspension. They told me there was no problem. 2 weeks later i came to see them because the problem worsened, i was around 100,500km and they said they could repair the problem for $1075+tax. I said i knew they could help me out considering I NEVER used a penny of my guarantee, and because i came to get the problem fixed BEFORE 100,000km. They said there’s nothing they can do for me and it was too bad. I literally gave them $2000 for that guarantee for absolutely no reason at all. My brother bought a car there a few weeks ago, they now raised the price to $3000.\n\nBought my car about 4 years ago. Havent had unusual problems with the car, but this review is for GRENIER Volkswagen dealership; not Volkswagen as a car company.\n\nWill not be buying another car here unless the guarantee is free. Feel like i got robbed of a $2000 guarantee.\n\nPS: the repair they wanted to charge me $1075+tax for, i got it done by another mechanic for $450 tax-in. These guys are thieves it’s disgusting.\n\nUPDATE: Director of sales gave me a call. He didnt have the attitude of someone trying to help/make a customer satisfied; he was just trying to invalidate my review which was a terrible way to handle an unhappy customer. I speak french but sometimes have trouble finding my words, so i asked « do you speak any english » his answer, in french « on est a Mascouche donc je va m’exprimer en français » (we live in mascouche so im going to speak in french). Didn’t know he wanted to be geopolitical about helping a client, not to mention the fact that HE called ME; i wasn’t the one who wanted to talk, HE was. He did speak in english a couple minutes later, and spoke perfect english. He just didn’t WANT to earlier in the conversation because of political reasons. Clearly wasn’t doing his best to adapt to his client. He never offered me ANYTHING to try and change my mind. NOTHING. Not a free oil change, not free tire storage, not even a discount on anything. NOTHING. 30min phone call was nothing but an arrogant tone trying to validate why i got such poor service. Already wasn’t impressed with Grenier Volkswagen, now I will shop 1 hour away for my next car before i step foot in Grenier Volkswagen 5 min away from my house. If anyone in management is reading this, maybe consider hiring staff with a better notion of customer service because this phone call didnt brighten my review on Grenier Volkswagen; it made it worse.\n\nPS: im not someone who just leaves 1star/2star reviews to hurt reputations. My reviews are honest; i have more positive reviews on my profile than bad ones. This place of business was just that bad of an experience.",

He was very friendly and professional from day one.  He answered all my questions and exceeded all my expectations at the same time.  He sent me the CarFax, which was clean.  He offered to take a video showcasing the car and sent it to me.  He also took pictures of the car getting brand new brakes and rotors.  Nobody has offered me such service in the past, EVER, and without even having to ask.\nMichel earned my trust and confidence that I was making the right choice.  The only thing that I had to worry about was getting to Chateauguay from NB and driving the WRX back home, over 800 kms away.\nI also want to thank Danila for helping me through the financing aspect of acquiring the car.  He was also very friendly and professional.\nI must say that this was the most pleasant car buying experience that I've had in over 30 yrs of driving.\nThe car was well priced, in great condition, low kms, brand new winter tires and looking brand new for a 2019.\n\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH!!  to everyone at Volkswagen Gabriel, from the secretary who answered my calls, to the detailer for making the car look immaculate, and the mechanics for making sure that the car was safe to drive.\n\n👍👍 ALL THE WAY!!",

I understand that the piece was out of stock but they could not even provide me with a car or anything even for a few days, and there was a big lack of communication. Had to constantly keep calling them and it took forever to finally get an update about what was really going on. Felt like the service could have been better, especially with the prices they charge. Also, they returned me my car key still detached from the FOB, and had apparently written down that I declined for a new key. I don’t know why I just assumed that they could micro weld or even hot glue the key back into the fob since it was just detached… Unless you absolutely have no choice, go to a garage. The receptionists and people itself are nice but the actual service is not worth the price imo. Also the car was given back to me way more dirty than I had left it",

I spend almost 900 dollar for the service of the car, just after a day I bought the car. When I asked them to refund me the amount of the service done by me, they became rude and pretended that they don’t know anything about the scene. The manager was only considering the point of not giving the refund. Its the worst experience of my life. I will say that never ever buy any car from here.",

I got an email from them today (one week later) asking if I’m going to be visiting in the next few days.\n\nYou did not even give me the vehicle information, you didn’t call me like you said and you’re asking me if I’m going to be visiting, from ONTARIO without taking to anyone? Clearly, it’s not a French English language barrier thing, but more of a priority or racism thing. I have never waited one week for a dealership to contact me back when I was asking for information about a car, and a week later to ask me when I’m visiting especially when I’m out of province and don’t know anything about the vehicle yet. I even told him that I’ve purchased vehicles in Quebec many times as Ontario resident. Unreal. I’m glad I don’t live in Quebec!",

When I went to plate the car in Ontario, I discovered I was missing key documents required for registration. Somehow, I left the dealer without everything. To make matters worse, I’m 3 hours away, and I couldn’t even extend it via an Ontario temporary permit without these documents, meaning the car was going off the road indefinitely.\n\nIn a panic, I made a frantic phone call back to the dealer and was fortunate enough to speak with Max Dube. Without diving into all the details, Max went above and beyond to save the day. He quickly got everything I needed, ensured I had the documents before the office closed, and made himself available throughout the entire process to ensure everything went smoothly. It’s worth mentioning this is a week after the sale as well. Thanks to his exceptional effort and willingness to go the extra mile, what could have been a week-long nightmare was resolved within hours, and I was plated and on my way with only minutes to spare.\nI am very impressed with, and incredibly thankful to Max and his commitment to outstanding customer service. Thank you, Max!",

Called them and told them my dilema... they said I needed to get it towed to them and they would look at it either that day of the next.  Being on vacation I really didn't want to wait and worry.   They provided a phone number of a local tow truck service.   Called and they said the wait would be 1.5 hrs  while waiting a kind man saw our car hood raised and asked if everything was OK.  I hold him my story and he offered to give me a boost.\n\nLuckily the car started and we went to Desjardins Volkswagen.   Got there and explained my situation and waited in the waiting area.  The waiting area has the same feel as my hometown VW dealership area,  this one us just smaller. Free coffee and water is always nice.\n\nThey told us it would be $69.95 + tax for a battery test.  After about 40 mins a man came to tell us the battery was dead.  The quote for a new battery, plus diagnostic and installation fee would be $320 plus tax.  Not cheap and had I been home I would have done the job myself.   20 mins later and a few hundred dollars later, we were on the road again.\n\nI'm so thankful they could take us the same day.\n\nIn hindsight,  I should have known the battery was near end of life.

They greedily wanted to keep the car and sell it for more rather than extending the courtesy to a long-time client. They don't care if you no longer wish to be locked in a lease. And finally, my Settlement Invoice was ridiculous. They added every possible detail to charge even though I spent thousands throughout my lease to return the car virtually spottless. This was completely contradictory to what they had told me I'd be charged and never advised me or attempted any communication, but rather surprise me with an absurd amount. My advise: shop around and take advantage of the many VW dealerships around greater Montreal area and procure the best deal and customer service possible, and don't leave anything to good faith. My advise to Rimar; improve your habits or suffer going out of business. Many past reviews echo my sentiments.",

Anyway, im not writing the review about that but that’s just one of the things that upset me about them.\n\nAt this point, my car still doesn’t start and I chose to send it to another garage. They charged me 2000$ to replace the master slave cylinder and bled the system.\nI then had a towing pick up the car to bring it to another garage. ( I never saw the inside of the car)\n\nVolkswagens techniciens left a bunch of parts sitting on the passenger seat.. (as seen on the photos I left attached to this review).\nI went directly to them and spoke about it but they said it wasn’t them.\nThe second garage I went to said it wasn’t them. Although I know it was Volkswagen because they had spoken to me about my dashboard as they went to mess around in it. Maybe to access the master slave clutch cylinder.\n\nExtremely disappointed.

When I got home with the car I noticed a part missing. I texted, emailed and called an no one replied.

                "text": "UPDATE: After getting in touch with the sales director,  as advised by @grenierauto.com, I discovered other issues with the vehicle. As soon as I found the other issues, I immediately advised the sales director Dominic F. After several weeks of painful negotiation to resolve the issues, having discussions going around in circles, being given several misleading information about the Consumer Protection Office laws, I was offered the replacement of the summer tires at their cost, including installation. But nothing, absolutely nothing, for the other issues, simply because I hadn't mentioned it in my review. And we're talking of about 200$ here, where I offered to buy the part and have them install it. During the negotiation, it was apparent that the only thing that mattered for the dealership was the review on here. I find this stance somewhat arrogant and certainly very poor customer service. So I decided to refuse their offer because it's simply not worth it. I've wasted enough of my time with this dealership and will not go back. I've had over a dozen VWs in my life and I was very loyal to the brand, in all the countries where I've lived. But I'm also saying goodbye to the brand. I've had enough. Auf wiedersehen VW, and yes, it's you, not me. :) ORIGINAL REVIEW: Another poor experience buying a used vehicle. I clearly asked the salesman about the state of the summer tires and he said they were in good condition. Before taking possession of the car, I asked the dealership to put the winter tires on. When I inspected the summer tires the following day, to store them, 2 of them were threadbare. Of course, the dealership refuse to do anything about it.",

Did you know that the ECM is riveted in a steel box making it impossible for your local mechanic to work on it. They want you to bring it in to the dealership and rip you off. I replaced 4 coils that came def all a the same time???

Moreover the beauty is the car I went to look got sold and I wasn’t even informed that it’s sold. I had to drive all the way to the showroom, just to hear this and drive back. Isn’t it the responsibility of the person who booked me in for an appointment to inform me as soon as the vehicle is sold? Shouldn’t the reminder message be sent to the person who is expecting a customer to visit them in an hour? And make sure the things are okay for what they are coming?

I asked them to bleed the hydraulic lines serving the clutch master cylinder, and replace it if faulty. They refused to bleed the lines, and instead said it was 'likely' the release bearing was 'leaking'. They then quoted a price of 800$+---to replace it, and 150$--for diagnostic work. I told them 'ok, put a new one in'. After a pause, the service guy said, ' well, if the bearing is gone, likely the clutch needs to be replaced too...1600$+. I said 'ok', put them both in. After another pause, he said, well, if the clutch is gone, the flywheel likely has a burn mark on it too...so you should replace that too (another 1600$). Now the total had jumped from 800$ for a 'possible' release bearing replacement if it was bad, to a all new clutch and flywheel...just 'in case' they were damaged...total now over 3300$ on just 'maybes'. This was nothing more than a cash grab. I promptly told them I was on my way to pick it up without their 'work' done. I picked it up an hour later, drove back to Nova Scotia without any clutch issues..or shifting issues at all. The long and short: I would never recommend them for service...extremely overpriced...'fixing things on a 'maybe' they need replaced'...and charging me 188$ to let me know they had no clue at all if anything was actually bad or definitely needed replacing. I would never recommend them for anything except maybe the clean smell of the reception area. I gave 2 stars because the girls at the reception area were friendly...as a service center, it is a ripoff, and a complete joke.",

I was told it would be about an 1 hour to an hour and a half.\nLast week, I dropped my car off at 12:30pm and was told it would be about 3 or 3 and a half hours.\nI returned at 3:45pm to see if my car was finished, as I had planned a drive based on the new estimate of time, although I did not receive a phone call updating me on my car. At 3:45pm I was told it would be another 45 minutes. I waited outside and returned at 4:40pm. I was told the inspection was finished, and work would need to be done to pass the inspection, and that the diagnostic test was being run now.\nI continued to wait for another 30 minutes,\nand my car was finished at 5:10pm, 4 hours and 40 minutes after my appointment time.\nWhile waiting I overheard that they were understaffed today. I understand these issues but the lack communication was extremely frustrating, as I had planned my day around this appointment. I will not be returning to service my car here.\nThe place I brought it to fix the issues had the work done in less time than it took Volkswagen to find the issues.",

Each time I have a specific question Sean Pitt is always able to answer it if not help me regarding it. Additionally, he is very kind and patient, he always ensures that he understands my request and will go out of his way to make sure that I am satisfied.\nI once had a very last-minute issue with the door handle and I had to leave out of the province for the summer, I popped in the morning to see if anything could be done. Unfortunately, all the mechanics were busy and not able to have a quick look at it to see if it could be fixed easily.\nHowever, Sean Pitt had a quick inspection of it and knew what had to be done to have it functioning again. In less than 5 minutes he had a fix and I did not have to go out of my way to book an appointment to only have that 5 minute fix for it. It was also free of charge (of course if the work scope was larger then I would have wanted to pay for it without a doubt but I was glad that a small fix like that was free of charge plus Sean Pitt took the time to torque my wheels too so that my car was good for the 14 hours drive that I had to do for my trip).\nI truly appreciate his kindness and expertise, if it is out of his scope he makes sure to recommend to me what is best for my car. I am extremely thankful that he works at the Fredericton Volkswagen since Sean Pitt is amazing!\n\nOn top of that, all the experiences that I had so far have been positive at the Fredericton Volkswagen Dealership. Their new dealership setup is also very neat for quick services. Their services are very well. I always bring my 2013 Volkswagen Golf Wolfsburg Edition there for its oil change. Each time I bring it in for an oil change they do a vehicle health inspection with it, my favorite part regarding it is they record it and share it with me to visually show me the problems. As somebody who works on cars, having this information is nice as I can judge if it is something easy that I can fix or if I am better off to make an appointment with them.\nAll my interactions have been very transparent and I never felt \"Scammed\" or \"Used.\"\nAlthough their hourly rate is a bit on the higher end for my personal preference, I am satisfied with the results they deliver so I do not mind the extra cost.\n\nThey once repaired one of my calipers that broke, two years went by and I never had an issue with it which is awesome (Plus they were ok with using a third-party part that was from Napa to be installed on it instead of an OEM VW caliper). These kinds of results have been consistent with the other repairs I had there, not once did I have to come back due to some \"XYZ\" reason after getting something repaired.\n\nOverall, thumbs up on my end and certainly to Sean Pitt for being great with his services!\nFor Admin, if possible it would be great if you could have this shared with Sean Pitt and for the management to see it.\nThank you!",

The new rim was delivered here but was not put on, but I was happily charged for it.

She called back a couple weeks later as the noise was getting worse, and there was literally chunks of rust falling out from under the car around the rotors. Jeff in service argued with her on the phone about what she was hearing and telling her it was impossible. He then told her she brought it in for a vibration, which is not why she had brought it in.

Here it is again.\n\nI have become aware of a troubling situation involving Jim Sampson Volkswagen in Sydney that raises concerns about potential negligence and predatory behavior.\n\nAn elderly acquaintance of mine, aged 71, purchased a new vehicle from this dealership and opted for an extended warranty. Unfortunately, at just 60,000 kilometers, a cooling problem surfaced, prompting multiple repair attempts over the following seven years. Despite these efforts, the issue persisted.\n\nUpon reaching 200,000 kilometers, and after the warranty had expired, the dealership charged $2000 for another repair. Regrettably, the problem remained unresolved, echoing the initial issue encountered at 60,000 kilometers.\n\nThis pattern of events suggests a troubling lack of accountability and customer care on the part of the dealership. Currently, an investigation is underway, and legal action is being pursued to address this matter appropriately.",

                "text": "First apt - I brought my 2014 Volkswagen Beetle (6 speed diesel turbo) & informed part service representative (dude on the phone + again in person at desk) that the clutch pedal was sticking to the floor & a fluid was leaking from pedal. I explained that I had the clutch bled already from another mechanic. This mechanic who has worked on Beetles before, he informed me that it was most likely the slave cylinder that needed to be replaced. I was advised that since he had seen this before to bring into Volkswagen as he did not have the proper equipment & it was not an easy part to get at. I told the dude who answered the phone in parts & service + again in person that I wanted the slave cylinder replaced. Nobody wanted to listen to me. They said they do a better job than the other mechanic & needed to bleed the clutch. I said there was no point in doing it unless they replaced the slave cylinder, too. Volkswagen service did not consider or even want to replace the slave cylinder. They changed my oil + bled the clutch. I said I would NOT be pleased if it just goes within a few weeks like I expected. They also put a sticker on my windshield for my following oil change & messed up the km's on it. Luckily, I noticed my oil percentage going down from the computer.. checked the oil myself + had to bring it to a local mechanic. The sticker said I didn't need my oil changed for another 12 000 km's.... boy, was that wrong. I'm so happy I picked up on this error.\n\nUnfortunately, as I expected, it wasn't even a week of driving it that my clutch pedal started sticking to the floor again. This time around, it got worse much faster. I couldn't even start my car. The computer was telling me to depress the clutch. So, I had to tow the vehicle at my own expense to the dealership again. This time around, they suggested replacing the master cylinder & could NOT explain why they thought it would be the master cylinder & not slave cylinder. They said it was the cheaper option. I said, \"I don't want the cheaper option.\" I made it clear that I simply wanted the option that would fix my car + prevent this issue from arising again. They would not listen to me. I even asked to speak w parts + service manager. One employee even rolled their eyes at me. They said at this point in time, the best solution they could offer was changing the master cylinder, & if it did NOT fix the issue, then their next recommendation would be to replace the transmission. Again, there was no explanation given as to why this would be better than replacing the slave cylinder, as I stated from the beginning. They said it was their recommendation & could not justify their reason behind it when I questioned yet again.\n\nI am pretty disgusted at this point. My daughter & I were driving to a banquet, and out of nowhere's, there was no indication that the clutch pedal was going to stick... no warning signs like the other 3 times. Luckily, neither of us was injured, & nothing happened to my car besides struggling to keep my clutch depressed after changing gears. I missed my daughter's banquet. She had to hop in another vehicle and attend the banquet without me. I was stuck in gears because the pedal wasn't working. I knew not to shut off my car... I made it to my local mechanic's garage, and it's been parked there since Oct 28th.\n\nSo not only did I pay for a master cylinder that didn't need to be replaced, along w the labor costs, I shouldn't have had to pay for a tow... after they bled the clutch without replacing slave cylinder.  Now, I am looking at more expenses to get my rig to the dealership (doubtful I will be going back to Sydney Volkswagen - unless they plan on retifying this situation). I also could have blown my motor.. from their error on the sticker, as they put on w the wrong amount of km's until my next oil change.\n\nAlso, maybe the website and information on google  should be updated concerning their hours of operation. I live an hour + 45 mins away. Only open til 5 on weekdays and said til noon on Sat. Nobody was willing (at their own convenience) to help...",

After diagnosis it was found the alternator was gone, only 120,000 kms on the car. I had that repaired along with the front and rear breaks. After leaving the dealership post repair the AC was no longer working - it had been working before - I returned to the dealership and the shop foreman took a Quick Look and said “well it has nothing to do with the repair we did” also had the service person I was dealing with reassure me that it had nothing to do with the repair. After spending a sum of money out there I asked well can it be taken in to diagnose since it was working before and they told me it would need an “AC appointment” which they only book two per day and have a wait list already, next appointment being in September. So now I am expected to drive in the hottest parts of the summer with a newborn baby with no AC. Do better Volkswagen. Last one I will be buying",

Coming from someone who works in sales, it is absolutely astounding the lack of response and zero follow up to a sales inquiry by the VW team. A sales team who put no effort into making a sale or retaining existing business. And this is not just one bad example, it has been my complete experience across the board over the last 7-8 years dealing with multiple members of Volkswagen in St.Johns. For the price, the service level is terrible. Extremely expensive parts, slow turnaround times, never offer a loaner suv. Do yourself a favour and hire a customer success management team to help retain your customer base.",

When the appt was made it was expressed then that we would drop and wait, We didn't have a have a full day to wait. Car was dropped off Sunday night for a 9am Monday appt. We called st 9 to remind them that we had a 12:30 deadline…. The wheels fell off right then. She advised she “would do her best”\n\nArrived at the dealer shop at 1045 and car was sitting in the parking lot. We were happy that the job was completed!\nWent into see a service adviser and they let us know that the car hadn’t been in yet….!?\nThe adviser was then very dismissive when we shared our time concern and said “ what would You like me to do?” I said then would You have a loaner car? “His response “well no”\n\nService manager comes out and states “Your 9am is for the service adviser not for the shop and You need to communicate better with Us your time constraints”\n\n…Umm Sir, we were very specific of our “time constraints” when We booked and were told it was “just a two hour job and would be done in plenty of time”. Service Manager was “shocked” by this statement! There was a 3.5 hrs allotted for a 2 hr job. But of course they over book.\n\nThen to make matters worse when the car did finally go in after 11am the service technician had Our car door open and was smoking at the car. Service Manager was a little surprised when I took issue with this!\nThen a woman pulled up to the  with a Jetta (no appt) and our technician began to help Her…?!! And brought out a computer to clear codes etc…\nSeems like we will be making a drive elsewhere for future service and maintenance needs.\n\n**update. The service manager did come back out to Us at 1215 and offer a loaner car as we needed to get my F.I.L. To an important medical appt at a Toronto hospital. (Thus our time constraint). That was very appreciated!  He did also give Us two coupons for a detailing. Thank You for hearing Our concerns, and speaking with Your team about importance of communicating customers needs within the team.",
